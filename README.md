# 🔋 Battery Management System Simulation

This project simulates a Battery Management System (BMS) that models energy usage across different operational modes (Idle, Moderate, Performance). It provides visualizations for power usage, estimated time remaining, and a dynamic State of Charge (SoC) gauge.

## 📊 Features

- Simulates real-time battery drain for 60 minutes.
- Power profiles vary across usage modes (Idle, Moderate, Performance).
- Live plots for:
  - Power Usage
  - Time Remaining
  - SoC Gauge
- CSV export of simulation logs.
